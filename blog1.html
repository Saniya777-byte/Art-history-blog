            <h2>Key Contributions of the Renaissance to Modern Art</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Emphasis on Humanism:</strong>The Renaissance celebrated human potential and individuality, shifting focus from religious themes to human-centric subjects. This philosophy inspires modern artists to explore personal and societal themes, emphasizing the depth and complexity of human experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Development of Perspective:</strong>Pioneers like Filippo Brunelleschi and Leonardo da Vinci introduced linear perspective, creating depth and realism in art. This technique revolutionized visual storytelling and remains a cornerstone of modern art and design, evident in everything from paintings to digital media.</li>
                <li><strong>Mastery of Light and Shadow (Chiaroscuro):</strong>Renaissance artists like Caravaggio mastered chiaroscuro to create dramatic contrasts between light and dark. Modern artists and filmmakers adopt this technique to add emotional intensity and dimensionality to their works.</li>

            <h2>Enduring Legacy in Modern Art</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Portraiture and Realism:</strong>Renaissance portraiture, epitomized by works like the Mona Lisa, set benchmarks for capturing human emotion. Contemporary portraiture, from hyperrealism to abstract representations, owes much to these foundations.</li>
                <li><strong>Exploration of Emotion and Narrative:</strong>The Renaissance focus on storytelling through art paved the way for modern genres like surrealism, where artists like Salvador Dal√≠ convey complex narratives through symbolic imagery.</li>
                <li><strong>Integration of Art and Science:</strong> Figures like Leonardo da Vinci exemplified the fusion of art and science. Today, modern artists and engineers collaborate in areas like virtual reality and bio-art, echoing Renaissance ideals of interdisciplinary creativity.</li>
